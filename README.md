# javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-fcc
My progress in the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course by freeCodeCamp. Iâ€™m learning JavaScript fundamentals (variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions, DOM) as well as OOP, Functional Programming, algorithmic thinking, local storage, and APIs.

# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository documents my learning journey through the **FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification**. The course covers the fundamentals of JavaScript and introduces key programming concepts such as algorithms, data structures, object-oriented programming (OOP), and functional programming.

## ðŸš€ Course Overview

The course is divided into several modules:

1. **Basic JavaScript** â€“ Variables, arrays, objects, loops, functions.
2. **ES6** â€“ Modern JavaScript features like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, template literals.
3. **Regular Expressions** â€“ Pattern matching and validation.
4. **Debugging** â€“ Identifying and fixing issues in code.
5. **Basic Data Structures** â€“ Arrays and objects in depth.
6. **Basic Algorithm Scripting** â€“ Problem-solving with simple algorithms.
7. **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** â€“ Classes, constructors, prototypes.
8. **Functional Programming** â€“ Higher-order functions, immutability, map/filter/reduce.
9. **Intermediate Algorithm Scripting** â€“ More complex problem-solving challenges.
10. **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects** â€“ Capstone projects to demonstrate skills.
